# Social media buzz prediction
## Task
Having data describing media events, the goal of this project was to predict the mean number of active discussions.

## Data
Data is described in datadescription.en.txt file.

## Solution
Solution consists of following steps:
1. Correlation matrix
2. PCA
3. Standardization
4. Box plots
5. Calculating outliers with Chauvenet's criterion
6. Multi Layer Perceptron
7. Recurrent Neural Network
8. Ridge Regression
9. ElasticNet regression
10. XGBoost
11. Box-Cox transformation

## Best Results
| Model | RMSE | MAE | R^2 |
|-------|------|-----|-----|
| XGBoost | 165.07 | 52.84 | 0.9 |
